The Q&A we faced from the panel
=======================================

1. What is the differs of Off-the-hook from the rest?
Off-the-hook in addition to detection if a site is a phish or not, gives what webpage, this phish is trying to copy.

2. Why was a Random Forest model used?
We wanted to get eliminate the overfitting problem, without spending much time bagging the features and records.

3. How you compute the memory usage by your application?
The OS allotes a processID(pid) for each process, and we get the pid for all components of Off-the-hook and sum them up to get the total memory usage.

4. Why was Fuzzy Rough Set Theory used for Feature Selection?
We are not sure on what features are realted to the labels and how they are related, and as Fuzzy Rough Set displays the relationships, it was used.

5. How can we make the whitelist better?
Having the URI stored as a trie with the levels similar to the DNS structure, followed by the directory structure and finally the html page as the leaf.

6. How can SHA be used for finding similairty?
By deault even a small change in the input must change the hash widely. And, so a modified version of SHA where the similar imputs have simlar MSB in the hash is used.
