\section{CONCLUSION}
A CNN model is developed to predict the genuineness of digital images. A digital image is formed after cycles of image generation processes and also might undergo tampering. By learning the features of tampered images during training the input image will be detected to be either spliced or not. Without any prior information of the source and the details of the forged image, the passive (blind) techniques detect the image forgery by evaluating the changes in the properties of an image. Thus, this model also identifies another type of passive forgery the image has undergone namely, copy move forgery.


\section{FUTURE WORK}
Will work on localization of tampered region in splicing forgery. Active type of forgery detection that also includes different filtering mechanism of images can be done in the future. Also inclusion of all formats of image can be done. Will also work on improving accuracy.
