Decentralization has gained a lot of attention due to its application in diverse fields. It is pioneered largely by Bitcoin, a blockchain technology and a financial application of decentralization, which has impacted a lot on how financial transactions happen in a secure manner. The advantage of using this technology is that there is no central authority to rely on. Thus a decentralized storage of insurance records would allow forgeries on the records to be reduced.

We propose a solution to avoid forgery in insurance sector using Blockchain. The blockchain network in the proposed system will timestamp and store insurance data and its associated files in the network storage. The network is decentralized thus the data is inherently secure. 

We also make use of smart contracts available in blockchain technology to enable auto insurance claim which will reduce a lot of time wasted in processing the claims. Hence, a system to securely store insurance data using blockchain technology can be implemented or created.
