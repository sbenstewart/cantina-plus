\section{Contributions}
In conclusion, this work deals with two approaches towards enhancing the performance of multicore systems and filesystems by exploiting reconfigurability.
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Exploiting reconfigurability in filesystems.} Our contribution is the idea of adding a dedicated reconfigurable hardware (Filesystem Access Accelerator) that can perform the filesystem's directory search operation faster than the software counterparts. We have illustrated the design of FAA for the \textit{ext2} file system and simulated the design using VHDL.

 \item  \textbf{Analysis of reconfigurable interconnection networks.} This work contributes the following: 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Implementing the \textit{Tarjan Connected Components Algorithm} \cite{RICN_paper} which synthesizes a topology specific to an application's communication pattern.
  \item A new interconnection network, omega network with various permutations has been added to Booksim.
  \item Booksim has been extended to support non-synthetic traffic patterns which is required for analysis of the synthesized topology. 
 \end{enumerate}
   
  The results obtained, corroborate the fact that, reconfigurable interconnection topologies specific to an application's communication pattern outperforms other standard topologies like torus, mesh and multi-stage networks like omega networks for smaller number of nodes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{File Access Accelerator.} Extend the design to accomodate \textit{ext3} filesystems.

\item \textbf{Reconfigurable ICN.} \begin{enumerate}
\item Analyze the possibilities of the synthesized topologies of various algorithms converging into any particular pattern. This work will eventually lead to a design of an network topologies that works optimally for majority of parallel applications and significantly reduce the communication bottleneck.
\item Address the scalability issue discovered in the reconfigurable topology synthesis algorithm.
\end{enumerate}


\end{itemize}
