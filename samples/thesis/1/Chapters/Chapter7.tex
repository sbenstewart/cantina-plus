\section{SUMMARY}
\lipsum[Users' reputation has great impact on the prediction of Web service QoS values. In this paper, we present an effective QoS prediction approach, namely RMF, for predicting unknown Web service QoS Values. We first calculate the reputation of each user based on their contributed QoS values. Then the user reputation is integrated into a matrix factorization (MF) prediction approach to get more accurate predictions. In phase 2, in order to prove our proposed approach outperforms other existing approaches. In addition to that to improve the consistency in accuracy and to predict the unreliable user we have planned to employ  intelligence algorithms to improve the calculation accuracy and rationality. Some feasible methods are listed as follows. 1) Exploiting statistical properties to measure users' consistency, and to identify unreliable users. 2) Taking the online condition into consideration, we may investigate reputation estimation methods (e.g. collaborative filtering method) to keep track of users' reputation, and detect spammers or unreliable users. We will also improve the RMF method to be suitable for an on-line algorithm. 3) Moreover, in terms of matrix factorization itself, we will attempt to composite other related information into our model to improve the prediction outcome, such as location.]

\section{FUTURE WORK}
The efficiency of   recommendation  of  a web service  is slight accurate.But this can be replaced by a better algorithm to improve the efficiency.Even more parameters can be taken into consideration for recommending the best web service.This would provide better results when more services are used in a particular web service.Thus there are a lot of improvements  and extensions possible and this system offers a wide scope in the field of web service.
