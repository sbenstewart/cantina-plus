# fileintel

This is a tool used to collect various intelligence sources for a given file.
Fileintel is written in a modular fashion so new intelligence sources can be
easily added.

Files are identified by file hash (MD5, SHA1, SHA256).  The output is in CSV
format and sent to STDOUT so the data can be saved or piped into another
program.  Since the output is in CSV format, spreadsheets such as Excel or
database systems will easily be able to import the data.

This works with Python v2, but it should also work with Python v3.  If you
find it does not work with Python v3 please post an issue.

This code has been tested on Windows 7 and Mac OSX El Capitan.  If you try this 
on any other type of machine please let me know!

## Help Screen:


```

                    ConfigurationFile InputFile

Modular application to look up file intelligence information. Outputs CSV to
STDOUT.

  -a, --all             Perform All Lookups.
  -v, --virustotal      VirusTotal Lookup.
  -n, --nsrl            NSRL Lookup for SHA-1 and MD5 hashes ONLY!
  -o, --otx             OTX by AlienVault Lookup.

  -r, --carriagereturn  Use carriage returns with new lines on csv.
```

# Install:

First, make sure your configuration file is correct for your
computer/installation.  Add your API keys and usernames as appropriate
in the configuration file.  Python and Pip are required to run this
tool.  There are modules that must be installed from GitHub, so be
sure the git command is available from your command line.  Git is easy
to install for any platform.  Next, install the python requirements
(run this each time you git pull this repository too):

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

There have been some problems with the stock version of Python on Mac
OSX
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31649390/python-requests-ssl-handshake-failure).
You may have to install the security portion of the requests library
with the following command:

```
$ pip install requests[security]
```

## NSRL

If you are using the NSRL database lookups, download the NSRL "Minimal" data
set as a zip file.  Put it in a directory you can access and point your
configuration file to that zip file.  There is no need to unzip the NSRL data.

## 7Zip

If you want to use 7Zip (fast) rather than the internal Python zip library
(slow) to read the large NSRL zip file, you will need to install 7Zip.
Windows installation of 7Zip is quite simple, but Mac OX X or Linux will need
to install p7zip, the command line tool.  For Mac OS X, you can install this
tool with Brew.  Once in install 7Zip you will need to point your
configuration file appropriate to wherever the 7z executable lies.

## Virtualenv

Lastly, I am a fan of virtualenv for Python.  To make a customized local
installation of Python to run this tool, I recommend you read:  
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

# Running:

```
$ python fileintel.py myconfigfile.conf myhashes.txt -a > myoutput.csv
```
You should be able to import myoutput.csv into any database or spreadsheet program.

**Note that depending on your network, your API key limits, and the
data you are searching for, this script can run for a very long time!
Use each module sparingly!  In return for the long wait, you save
yourself from having to pull this data manually.**

## Sample Data:

There is some sample data in the "sampledata" directory.  The hashes
were picked at random and by no means is meant to target any
organization or individual.  Running this tool on the sample data
works in the following way:

# To Do:

- Try to incorporate threat feeds from http://www.secrepo.com
- Add malware sandbox intelligence
- Add smart lookup based upon hash type
- Better hash detection (for example, 0-9, A-F characters only)
- Look at https://github.com/Yelp/threat_intel
