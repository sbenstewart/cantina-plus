\section{CONCLUSION}
A system that can be used on all platforms for detecting phishing sites has been developed. This works totally on the client side without the need for heavy computational resources that use servers. It is also very easy install and use on all machines even on ones that run short on main memory as it requires just around 120MB at peak times. The main benefit of this system is that it will in most cases find the target site which has been modified as a phish by the malicious actor. Thus the user will know the correct website to access as well.

\section{FUTURE WORK}
Will work on the improvement of the data transfer mechanisms between the modules, which will greatly reduce the resource constraints as all modules will not be required to run all the times. We will also work on improving the accuracy of the phish detector, while making the target identifier more robust and able to identify a lot more websites.
